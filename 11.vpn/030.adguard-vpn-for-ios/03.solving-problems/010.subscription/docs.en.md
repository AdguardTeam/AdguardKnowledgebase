AdGuard VPN is available in two versions — free and unlimited. The subscription allows you to use the app on maximum: without restrictions on traffic, connection speed and the choice of locations. You can read more about all the advantages of the unlimited version in [this article](link).

If you have decided to activate a paid subscription to AdGuard VPN, there are three ways to do this:

1. The first option is through an in-app purchase in the app itself. To do this, go to AdGuard VPN and click on the arrow in the upper-right corner of the screen. There are two types of subscriptions to choose from — annual (paid once every year) and monthly (paid once a month). Select the highest priority for you and click "Subscribe". Confirm the purchase using Touch ID or entering the account password from your Apple ID. Your subscription is activated!

2. You can also subscribe to AdGuard VPN on [our website](https://adguard-vpn.com/license.html). Choose a convenient subscription option (annual or monthly) and enter the email address to which the payment receipt will be sent. You can pay for your subscription using your credit card or PayPal account.

3. You can also subscribe via [AdGuard personal account](https://my.adguard.com/ru/main.html), if you have one. Log in to your account and select "My Licenses" from the menu on the left. Click "Buy AdGuard VPN" and select an annual or monthly subscription. Pay for it using your credit card or PayPal account. Done!
